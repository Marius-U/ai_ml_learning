# Getting Started Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai_ml_learning

# Activate the existing ML environment
source ~/venv/ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ~/venv/ml-env/Scripts/activate

# Install/update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch the Training
```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook

# Open the main training notebook
# notebooks/ml_ai_101_training_complete.ipynb
```

### 3. Verify Installation
Run the first cell of the notebook to verify all libraries are installed correctly.

## Learning Path
