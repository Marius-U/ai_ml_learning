# Training Notebooks

This directory contains the core ML training materials.

## 📚 Notebook Overview

### **Primary Training Material**
- **`ml_ai_101_training_complete.ipynb`** - ⭐ **START HERE** ⭐
  - Complete, production-ready ML training
  - Proper cell order and flow
  - Interactive assessments and checkpoints
  - 8-12 hours of comprehensive content

### **Alternative Versions**
- **`ml_ai_101_training_enhanced.ipynb`** - Enhanced version with additional advanced topics
- **`ml_ai_101_training_original.ipynb`** - Original version (reference only)

## 🎯 Recommended Learning Path

1. **Begin with**: `ml_ai_101_training_complete.ipynb`
2. **Prerequisites**: Basic Python, elementary statistics
3. **Time commitment**: 8-12 hours (can be done in modules)
4. **Completion criteria**: 70%+ on all checkpoint assessments

## 🛠️ Before You Start

1. Ensure your environment is set up (see `../docs/getting-started.md`)
2. Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Have a stable internet connection for API examples
4. Clear at least 2-3 hours for each training session

## 📊 Learning Modules

Each notebook is organized into these main sections:

1. **Environment Setup** (15 min)
2. **Data Preprocessing** (45 min)
3. **Model Evaluation** (40 min)
4. **Real-world Integration** (50 min)
5. **Production Deployment** (30 min)
6. **End-to-end Project** (60 min)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Track your progress with these milestones:
- [ ] Complete environment validation
- [ ] Build first preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Train and evaluate multiple models
- [ ] Connect to real data sources
- [ ] Deploy and version a model
- [ ] Complete capstone project

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Run every code cell** - don't just read
- **Complete all checkpoints** - they validate understanding
- **Experiment with parameters** - try different values
- **Use your own data** - apply concepts to real problems
- **Join the community** - ask questions and share insights

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Import errors**: Check `requirements.txt` installation
- **Memory issues**: Restart kernel between large datasets
- **API failures**: Check internet connection and rate limits
- **Version conflicts**: Use the specified library versions

**Need Help?**
- Check the `../docs/` directory for additional guidance
- Open an issue on GitHub for specific problems
